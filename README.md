Margin trading allows you to add leverage to increase your earnings and profits, so Binance enabled the Margin Level to evaluate the risk level of your margin account.   How to Calculate Margin Level?  Margin Level= Total Asset Value/(Total Borrowed Value + Total Accrued Interest Value)  *The actual amount you can borrow will be calculated by the system.   If your Margin Level is greater or equal to 1.5, then you can use all the functions normally. You can trade, loan and transfer in your margin account.   If your Margin Level is less than or equal to 1.3, a Margin Call will be triggered, you will receive notification through text and email.
